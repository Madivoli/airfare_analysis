**Introduction**

This project leverages the U.S. airline passenger and fare dataset (1993-2024) to demonstrate how data-driven insights can be a competitive advantage for the bus industry in Kenya. By applying advanced data analysis techniques, this analysis will reveal popular routes, passenger travel patterns, seasonal trends, and competitive dynamics in the airline market.

The findings can be used as a strategic blueprint for Tahmeed Bus Company's senior managers to:
- **Evaluate current routes for potential high-demand corridors.**
- **Identify opportunities for new routes where demand is high, and a competitive pricing strategy could attract passengers.**
- **Optimize pricing strategies by understanding seasonal fluctuations and competitor pricing.**
- **Gain a competitive advantage by anticipating market shifts and making informed, proactive business decisions.**
  
The analysis highlights how a structured approach to data can move Tahmeed Bus Company from being reactive to proactive, ensuring sustainable growth and market leadership in the East African transportation industry and beyond. The project involved data cleaning and transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data analysis with DAX, and data visualization using Tableau. 

The analysis aimed to answer the following business questions:
1.	**Which is the most profitable and popular route?**
2.	**Is there a correlation between distance and fare? If there is a relationship, what is the type of relationship?**
3.	**Which is the busiest city and airport? Both outgoing and incoming?**
4.	**What are the fare and passenger travel patterns over the years?**
   
By analyzing travel patterns, pricing strategies, and the industry’s competition, Tahmeed Bus Company can optimize existing routes, launch new routes and services, and capitalize on underserved markets — enhancing passenger experience, reducing operational costs and increasing market share.
